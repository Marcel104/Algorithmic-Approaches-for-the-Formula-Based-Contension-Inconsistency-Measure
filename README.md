# Formula-Based Contension Inconsistency Measure

This project is based on my Master-Thesis 'Algorithmic Approaches for the Formula-Based Contension Inconsistency Measure' at the 'Fernuniversit√§t in Hagen'.

To calculate the formula-based contension inconsistency measure (Ifc) we use the three-valued logic by Graham Priest where we can assign each Atom a third truth-value 'both'.
Ifc now calculates the minimum of formulas, where at least one atom got assigned the value 'both'. The agorithmic approaches, provided in this project, use Max SAT Solver and Answer Set Programming.
